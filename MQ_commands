Service objects
Name list
Process definition
Pub& Sub

Crtmqm name -for creating manager
Dspmqm -displaying manager
Note:after creating manager state is ended immediately
Strmqm name - to start manager
Note:then the start will be running
Q:what is manager
A:first and foremost object for MQ 
QManager is the place where MQ objects interact with each other for putting and getting messages.

Dltmqm name:for delect QManager
Note: we can not delete running QManager we have to end
Endmqm name :to stop / end QManager
Runmqsc: script command for creating channel and listener etc. inside QManager mqsc commands will be executed outside  QManager control command will executed it is level 

Mqsc commands:
Alter
Clear
Define
Display
End
Exit
Ping
Purge
Quit
Refresh
Reset
Resolve
Resume
Set
Start
Stop
Suspend
For coming out from QManager we use end, quit,exit.

Display Qmgr :Display QManager properties like create date time.
Display QMSTATUS ALL : To see the status of QManager
Note: ounce object name is created it can not be changed or duplicate. Ibm mq is case sensitive.
 For creating objects   we have 3 types of commands
 1 control commands(os level)
 2 mqsc commands(qmgr)
 3 ocf command
 QUEUE:
 1.PREDEFINED QUEUES
    LOCAL QUEUE
    ALIAS QUEUE
    REMOTE QUEUE
    MODEL QUEUE
  2.DYNAMIC QUEUE
     PERMANENT DYNAMIC QUEUE
     TEMPERORY DYNAMIC QUEUE
DEFINE QLOCAL(NAME) : creating local queue
DESPLAY QLOCAL (NAME): To see whether QLOCAL is created are not and date, time.
CLRDEPTH: current dupth it show whether messages available present count.
MAXDEPTH:the queue can hold maximum 5000 messages only.

amqsput remoteqname qmanagername:to put messages

amqsget qname qmanagername:to get messages 

The MAXDEPTH we can increase to 999999999

If we want change any property we use alter.changing MAXDEPTH as 10
Ex: ALTER QLOCAL(NAME) MAXDEPTH (10)

MQRC  (error code):mq resion code to check what error.

MAXMSGL(max message length): maximum size of one message default size is 4mb we can increase maximum upto 100mb only.
DELETE QLOCAL (NAME) :To delete QLOCAL 
Note:we can delete if queue is empty only.

CLEAR QLOCAL(NAME): we are deleted messages with out getting messages.

DEFPSIST(NO): The default def persistenc is no is message type is non persistenc messages 

In MQ we have two types of messages persistenc and non persistenc messages 
Non persistenc messages will be discarded or deleted during 
QManager is restarted. Persistenc messages store in hard-disk and non persistenc messages will store in QManager buffer.
Note:0=non persistenc 1=persistenc when we make application level as 1 and queue level as 0 it will take application level only. If we have not mentioned anything in application level thebn it will take queue level.


DISPLAY QLOCAL (SYSTEM.DEFAULT.LOCAL.QUEUE) -this is default local queue or parent queue this property will come to whatever we create local queue like Child. If we delete default queue we can not create queues in that QManager and we can't create default queue
Note:if default queue is deleted follow the steps
1 ENDMQM QManager name -end the QManager 
2 STRMQM -c QManager nane - will create replace the objects 
3 STRMQM QManager name -start.

If you have two queue 'a' and 'b' .the properties of 'a' has alter and you want 'a' properties to 'b' also command is 
DEFINE QLOCAL(b) LIKE(a)

VIDEO 5:

how to see no.of queues in qmanager
DISPLAY QLOCAL(*)
DISPLAY QLOCAL(Q*) it will display only starting with q

DISPLAY QLOCAL(QNAME)
DISPLAY QSTATUS(QNAME)

MONQ(OFF) it is monotering b default is off if we make it as high or low and medium in status we can see 
LGETDATE() LGETTIME()  last date and time message get 
LGETDATE() LPUTTIME()  last date message put
NOTE:this date we can see when we make monq as high
ALTER QLOCAL(QNAME) MONQ(HIGH)

MSGAGE() it is message age is default unlimit
set the message age
DISPLAY QLOCAL(QNAME)
ALTER QLOCAL(QNAME) CUSTEM('CAPEXPRY(600)')  ->we have set expary for message of one minite
if it is persistence or not if we set age it will expair

DISPLAY QSTATUS(QNAME)
OPPROCS() the no of queues connected to put messages
IPPROCS() the no of  queues connected to get messages

DISPLAY QSTATUS(QNAME) TYPE(HANDLE) OPENTYPE(OUTPUT) ->it get user id noof application to put messages
DISPLAY QSTATUS(QNAME) TYPE(HANDLE) OPENTYPE(INPUT) ->it get user id noof application to get messages
  
ALIAS: alias key does not hold message if we put message to b it will go to a and we can get from b 
DEFINE QLOCAL(A)
DEFINE QALIAS(B) TARGET(A)
DISPLAY QALIAS(B)
